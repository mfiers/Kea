   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to the Mad/Kea documentation
====================================

Mad/Kea is a system to annotate files and use these annotations in a common
commandline environment. The system has two tools: *Mad* to annotate files and,
more experimental: *Kea* which assists in using the mad information (and more) in
normal command line operations.

The project is under heavy development / documentation will grow in the future.
